# pthread:
- pthread is used to create new threads

- To create a `pthread` we have to use `pthread_create`, which takes:  
  - `pthread_t tid;` => creates thread id
  - `pthread_attr_t attr;` => creates thread attribute
  - `pthread_attr_init(&attr);` => to initialize the attribute
  - `pthread_create(&tid, &attr, sum_runner, &limit);`
  - `sum_runner` is the function (`start_routine`) that we created to do some work for us.
  - `&limit` is the address of the `arg` that is passed to `start_routine` in our case, `sum_runner`.
**Note:**
- `arg` is a sole argument, can't pass more than one argument.
- `pthread_join` wait for the thread tp terminate, it takes two arguments:
  - `int pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void **retval);`
  - In our case they are `(tid, NULL)`
  - It's `NULL` because we are not expecting any return value

- We have to use `pthread_exit(0)` to finish the thread in our `sum_runner`
