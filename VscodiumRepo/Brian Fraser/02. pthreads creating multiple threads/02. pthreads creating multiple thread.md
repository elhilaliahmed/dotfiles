# multiple thread:
- we need to have a unique id for each thread we spawn 
- basically we should create an array of thread id, `pthread_t tids[num_args]`
- `sum_runner` expect only a single pointer, a single `arg`, a workaround that is to use: 
  - a pointer to a `struct`
``` c
    struct sum_runner_struct {
        long long limit;
        long long answer;
    };
```
- This basically tricks `sum_runner` into taking more than one `arg` ***implicitly***.
- This is quite a powerful way, because I can pass in any data to my struct
- I can add extra fields and access them inside the `sum_runner`
