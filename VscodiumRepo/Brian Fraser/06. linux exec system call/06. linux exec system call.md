# Using `execvp`
- We are going to use `execvp` inside the program generated by `execDemo.c` to run the program generated by `helloExec.c`
# Difference between the exec system calls:

- With L: comma separated arguments
- With V: Vecotr (i.e., an array of strings)
- With P: Include normal search path for executable
## What happens after running `execvp`
- After running `execvp(args[0], args)` the program will be totally replaced with the new program we are calling. It basically replaces itself and ceases to exits.

# Exec and `fork()`
- The `fork()` call can be expensive if it's not done the right way. 
- Linux implements it very effeciently
- Between `fork()` and exec, we should do as little as possible
  - Better not to change global data
  - and the allocated memory
