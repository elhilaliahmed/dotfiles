# The difference between String and StringBuffer:

- If the content is fixed and won't change frequently then it is recommended to go for `String`.
- If the content is not fixed and keep changes frequently then it is not recommended to use `String`, because for every change a new object will be created which effects the perfermance of the system. To handle this requirements we should go for `StringBuffer`.
- The main advantage of `StringBuffer` over `String` is all required changes will be performed on the existing object only.

# StringBuffer constructors:
  `StingBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();` creates an empty `StringBuffer` object default initial `capacity` equals 16, once `StringBuffer` reaches its maximum *capacity* a new `StingBuffer` object will be created with a `newCapacity = (current capacity + 1) * 2;`
``` java
    StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
    System.out.println(sb.capacity());      => 16

    sb.append("abcdefghijklmnop");
    System.out.println(sb.capacity());      => 16

    sb.append("q");
    System.out.println(sb.capacity());      => 34
```
`StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(int initialCapacity); ` creates an empty `StrinBuffer` object with specified *initial capacity*.\
`StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(String s);` creates an equivalent `StringBuffer` for the given `String` with `capacity = s.length() + 16`
 #### ***Example:***
  ``` java
    StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Ahmed");
    System.out.println("sb.capacity())   => 21
  ```
# Important methods of StringBuffer:
`public int length();`\
`public int capacity();`\
`public char charAt(int index);`
  #### ***Example:***
  ``` java
    StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Ahmed")
    System.out.println(sb.chatAt(3));    => e
    System.out.println(sb.chatAt(30));   => runtime exception: StringIndexOutOfBoundsException
  ```
  `public void setCharAt(int index, char ch);` to replace the character located at a specified index with provided character.\
  \
  \
  `public StringBuffr append(String s);`\
  `public StringBuffr append(int i);`\
  `public StringBuffr append(long l);`\
  `public StringBuffr append(char ch);`\
  `public StringBuffr append(boolean b);`\
...     All these methods are *overloaded* methods.
 #### ***Example:***
  ``` java
    StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
    sb.append("PI value is: ");
    sb.appedn(3.14);
    sb.append(" It is exactly: ");
    sb.append(true);
    System.out.println(sb);    => PI value is: 3.14 It is exactly true
  ```
  \
  `public StringBuffr insert(int index, String s);`\
  `public StringBuffr insert(int index, int i);`\
  `public StringBuffr insert(int index, long l);`\
  `public StringBuffr insert(int index, char ch);`\
  `public StringBuffr insert(int index, boolean b);`\
  ...   All these methods are *overloaded* methods.
 #### ***Example:***
  ``` java
    StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("abcdefgh");
    sb.insert(2, "xyz");
    System.out.println(sb);    => abxyzcdefgh
  ```
  `public StringBuffer delete(int begin, int end);` to delete characters located from begin index to end - 1 index, ***[begin, end[***.\
  \
  `public StringBuffer deleteCharAt(int index);` to delete the character located at specified index.\
  \
  `public StringBuffer reverse();` 
  ``` java
    StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Ahmed");
    System.out.println(sb.reverse());  => demha
  ```
  `public void setLenth(int length);`
  ``` java
    StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Ahmed Elhilali");
    sb.setLength(8);
    System.out.println(sb);  => Ahmed El
  ```
  `public void ensureCapacity(int capacity)`; to increase capacity on fly based on our requirement
  ``` java
    StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
    System.out.println(sb.capacity());      => 16
    
    sb.ensureCapacity(1000);
    System.out.println(sb.capacity()):      => 1000
  ```
  `public void trimToSize()`; to deallocate extra allocated free memory
  ``` java
    StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(1000);
    sb.append("abc");
    sb.trimToSize();
    System.out.println(sb.capacity());      => 3
  ```
  # StringBuffer vs StringBuilder:
  - Every method that is present in `StringBuffer` is `synchronized`, hence only one `thread` is allowed to operate on `StringBuffer` object at a time, which may create performance problems. 
  - To handle this requirement some people introduced `StringBuilder` concept in 1.5v.
  - `StringBuilder` is exactly the same as StringBuffer except the following differences:
  
  - Every method present in `StringBuffer` is `synchronized`.
  - Every method present in `StringBuilder` is `non-synchronized`.
  
  - At a time only one `thread` is allowed to operate on a `StringBuffer` object. Hence `StringBuffer` is `thread-safe`.
  - At a time multiple `threads` are allowed to operate on a `StringBuilder` object. Hence `StringBuilder` is `not thread-safe`.
  
  - `threads` are required to wait to operate on `StringBuffer` object, hence relatively performance is low.
  - `threads` are not required to wait to operate on `StringBuilder` object, hence relatively performance is high.
  
  - `StringBuffer` was introduced in 1.0v.
  - `StringBuilder` was introduced in 1.5v.
 
   
   | StringBuffer|StringBuilder|
   |:-----------|:-----------|
   |1. synchronized|1. non-synchronized|
   |2. thread-safe|2. thread-unsafe|
   |3. low performance|3. high performance|
   |4. 1.0v|4. 1.5v

   **Note:**
   - Except the above difference everything is the same in `StringBuffer` and `StringBuilder`, including methods and constructors.
  # String vs StringBuffer vs StringBuilder:
  1. If content is fixed and won't change frequently then we should go for `String`.
  2. If the content is not fixed and changes frequently but *thread safety* is **required** then we should go for `StringBuffer`.
  3. If the content is not fixed and changes frequently but *thread safety* is **not required** then we should go for `StringBuilder`.
# Method chaining:
- For most of the methods in `StringBuffer` and `StringBuilder` return type same type, hence after applying a method we can call another method on the result, which forms *method chaining*.
- `sb.m1().m2().m3().m4()...` in method chaining method calls will be executed from *left* to *right*.
  ``` java
    StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
    sb.append("Ahmed").append(" Elhilali").append(" Keller").insert(2, "abc").reverse().delete(2, 10);
    System.out.println(sb);      => relihlE demcbahA
