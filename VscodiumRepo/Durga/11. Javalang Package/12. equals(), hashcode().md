# Relation between `==` operatorn and `equals()` method:
1.  If two objects are equal by `==` operator then these objects are always equal by `equals()` method, that is:
    -  if `r1 == r2` is `true` then `r1.equals(r2)` is always `true`.
2. If two objects are not equal by `==` operator then we can't conclude anything about `equals()` method, it may returns `true` or `false`, that is:
    - if `r1 == r2` is `false` then `r1.equals(r2)` may return `true` or `false`.
3. If two objects are equal by `equals()` method, then we can't conclude anything about `==` operator it may return `true` or `false`, that is:
   - if `r1.equals(r2)` is `true` then we can't conclude anything about `r1 == r2`. It may return `true` or `false`.
4. If two objects are not equal by `equals` method, then these objects are always not equal by `==` operator, that is:
   - if `r1.equals(r2)` is `false`, then `r1 == r2` is always `false`.


# Differences between `==` operator and `equals()` method:
- To use `==` operator compulsory there should be some relationship between arguments types (either *child* to *parent* or *parent* to *child* or *same* type), otherwise we will get compile time error saying ***incomparable types***
- If there's not relation between arguments types then equals() won't rise any *compile-time* or *runtime* errors, it will simply return `false`.
``` java
    String s1 = new String("Ahmed");
    String s2 = new String("Ahmed");

    StringBuffer sb1 = new StringBuffer("Ahmed");
    StringBuffer sb2 = new StringBuffer("Ahmed");

    System.out.println(s1 == s2);           => false
    System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));      => true

    System.out.println(sb1 == sb2);         => false
    System.out.println(sb1.equals(sb2));    => false

    System.out.println(s1 == sb1);          => compile-time error: incomparable types: java.lang.String and java.lang.StringBuffer
    System.out.println(s1.equals(sb1));     => false
```
| `==` operator   | `equals()` method    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| 1. It's an operator in java applicable for both *primitives* and *objects* types    | 1. It's a method applicable only for *objects* types but not for *primitives*    |
| 2. In the case object references `==` operator meant for reference comparison (address comparison)   | 2. By default `equals()` method present in Object class also meant for reference comparison
| 3. We can't override `==` operator for content comparison   | 3. We can override `equals()` for content comparison
| 4. To use `==` operator compulsory there should be some relation between arguments type (either *child* to *parent* or *parent* to *child* or *same* type) otherwise we will get compile time error saying ***incomparable*** types  | 4. If there is no relation between arguments types then `equals()` method won't rise any *compile-time* or *runtime* errors, and simply returns `false`
|

## One line summarize of the differences:
- In general we can use `==` operator for reference comparison and `equals()` method for content comparison.

**Note:**
- For any object reference `r`,
  ``` java
    r == null;
    r.equals(null);
  ```
    always returns `false`.
#### ***Example:***
  ``` java
   Thread t = new Thread();
   System.out.println(t == null);       => false
   System.out.println(t.equals(null));  => false  
  ``` 
**Note:**
- Hashing related datastructures follow the following fundamental rule: two equivalent objects should be placed in the *same bucket* but all object present in the same bucket need not be equal.


# Contract between `equals()` method and `hashCode()` method:
- If two objects are equal by `equals()` method then their *hashcodes* must be equal. That is two equivalent objects should have the same `hashcode`. That is:
    - if `r1.equals(r2)` is `true` then `r1.hashCode() == r2.hashCode()` is always `true`.
- `Object` class `equals()` method and `hashCode()` method follows the previous contract hence whenever we are overriding `equals()` method compulsory we should override `hashCode()` method to satisfy the previous contact. That is two equivalent objects should have the same *hashcode*.
- If two objects are not equal by `equals()` method then there is not restriction on hashcodes. The hashcodes might or might not be equal.
- If *hashcodes* of two objects are equal then we can't conclude anything about equals() method, it may return `true` or `false`.
- If *hashcodes* of two objects are not equal then these objects are always not equals by `equals()` method.

**Note:**
- To satisfy contract between `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods whenever we are overriding `equals()` method compulsory we have to override `hashCode()` method. Otherwise we won't get any *compile-time* or *runtime* errors but it's not a good programming practice.

# `String` class `equals()` method and `hashCode()` method:
- In `String` class `equals()` method is overriden for content comparison, and hence `hashCode()` method is also overriden to generate hashcode besed on content.
``` java
    String s1 = new String("Ahmed");
    String s2 = new Stirng("Ahmed");

    System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));  => true

    System.out.println(s1.hashCode());  => 63235109
    System.out.println(s2.hashCode());  => 63235109   
```
- In `StringBuffer` class `equals()` method is not overriden for content comparison and hence `hashCode()` method is not overriden. 
``` java
    StringBuffer sb1 = new StringBuffer("Ahmed");
    String sb2 = new StirngBuffer("Ahmed");

    System.out.println(sb1.equals(sb2));  => false

    System.out.println(sb1.hashCode());  => 19621457
    System.out.println(sb1.hashCode());  => 4872882   
```
Consider the following `Person` class:
#### ***Example:***
  ``` java
    class Person {

        private String name;
        private int age;
        private int socialSecurityNumber;

        public boolean equals(Object obj) {
            if (this == obj) {
                return true;
            }

            if (obj instanceof Person) {
                Person p = (Person)obj;
                if (name.equals(p.name) && age == p.age) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
            return false
        }

    }  
  ```
Appropriate `hashCode()` method for `Person` class is:
``` java
    public int hashCode() {
        return name.hashCode() + age;
    }
```
Inappropriate `hashCode()` methods for `Person` class are:
``` java
    public int hashCode() {
        return 100;
    }
```
``` java
    public int hashCode() {
        return age + socialSecurityNumber;
    }
```

**Note:**
- Based on which parameters we used to override `equals()` method, it's highly recommended to use the same parameters while overriding `hashCode()` method also.
- In all collection classes, in all wrapper classes and in String class `equals()` method is overriden for content comparison, hence it's highly recommended to override `equals()` method in our class also for contenct comparison.
