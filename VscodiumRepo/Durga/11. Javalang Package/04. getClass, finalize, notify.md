# getClass() method:
* We can use `getClass()` method to get *runtime* class definition of an object.
  `public final Class getClass()`
* By using this `Class class` object we can access Class level properties like: 
    1. Fully qualified name of a class
    2. Methods information
    3. Constructors information etc...
    ```java
        import java.lang.reflect*; // Method is present here
        class Test {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                int count = 0;
                Object o = new String("Ahmed");
                Class c = o.getClass();
                
                System.out.println("Fully qualified name of class: " + c.getName());

                Method[] m = c.getDeclaredMethods();
                System.out.println("Methods information: ");
                for (Method m1 : m) {
                    System.out.println(m1.getName());
                    count++;
                }
                System.out.println("Number of methods is: " + count);
            }
        }
    ```
**Note:**
- After loading every *.class* file, *jvm* will create an object data type `java.lang.Class` in the heap area. Programer can use this class object to get class level information.
- We can use `getClass()` very frequently in reflections.
# finalize() method: 
- Just before destroying an object, *garbage collector* calls `finalize()` method to perfom **clean up** activities. Once `finalize()` method completes automatically *garbage collector* destroys that object.
# wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() methods:
- We can use these methods for inter-thread comunications. 
- The thread which is expecting updation, it is responsible to call `wait()` method, then immediatly enter into *waiting state*. 
- The thread which is responsible to perform updation, after performing updation the thread can call `notify()` method, the waiting thread will receive that notification and continue its excecution with those updates.
