# java.lang.String class:
## String immutability (String vs StringBuffer):
### Case 1:
```java
    String s = new String("Ahmed");
    s.concat(" Elhilali");
    System.out.println(s); => Ahmed
```
  - Once we create a `String` object, we can't perfom any change on the existing object. If we are trying to perform any change, with those changes a new object will be created. This non-changeable behaviour is nothing but ***immutability*** of `String` object.
```java
    StringBuffer s = new StringBuffer("Ahmed");
    s.concat(" Elhilali");
    System.out.println(s); => Ahmed Elhilali
```
- Once we create a `StringBuffer` object, we can perfom any change on the existing object. This changeable behaviour is nothing but ***mutability*** of `StringBuffer` object.   

### Case 2:
```java
    String s1 = new String("Ahmed");
    String s2 = new String("Ahmed");
    System.out.println(s1 == s2);       => false
    System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));  => true
```
  - In `String` class `equals()` method is overriden for content comparison, hence even though objects are different if content is the same `equals()` return `true`.
```java
    String s1 = new String("Ahmed");
    String s2 = new String("Ahmed");
    System.out.println(s1 == s2);       => false
    System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));  => false
```
- In `StringBuffer` class `equals()` method is not overriden for content comparison, hence `Object` class `equals()` method got excecuted which is meant for ***reference*** comparison (*address* comparison). Due to this, if objects are different `equals()` method return false even though content is the same. 

### Case 3:
```java
    String s = new String("Ahmed");
```
  - In this case, two objects will be created, one in the *heap* area and the other in the **string constant pool** (SCP), and `s` is always pointing to *object*.

| Heap   | SCP    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| s -> Ahmed   | Ahmed   |

```java
    String s = "Ahmed";
```
- In this case, only one object will be created in *SCP*, and `s` is always pointing to the object.

| Heap   | SCP    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
|    | s -> Ahmed   |
|

**Note:**
- Object creation in *SCP* is optional, first it will check is there any object already present in *SCP* with the required content, if the object is already present, then the existing object will be reused. If the object is not already available then only the new object will be created.
-  This rule is only applicable for *SCP* but not for the *heap*.
-  *Garbage collector* (*GC*) is not allowed to access *SCP* area. Hence even though object doesn't contain *reference variable* it's not eligible for *GC* if it is present in *SCP* area. 
-  All *SCP* objects will be destoyed automaticaly at the time of *jvm* shutdown.

#### Example 1: 
``` java
    String s1 = new String("Ahmed");
    String s2 = new String("Ahmed");
    String s3 = "Ahmed";
    String s4 = "Ahmed";
```
| Heap   | SCP    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| s1 -> Ahmed    | s3, s4 -> Ahmed   |
| s2 -> Ahmed||
|
**Note:**
- Whenever we are using a `new` operator an new object will created in the *heap* area. Hence there many be a chance of existing two objects with the same content in the *heap* area but not in *SCP*. That is duplicate objects are possible in the *heap* area but not in *SCP*.

#### Example 2: 
``` java
    String s1 = new String("Ahmed");
    s1.concat(" Elhilali");
    String s2 = s1.concat(" El");
    s1 = s1.concat(" Keller");
    System.out.println(s1); => Ahmed El
    System.out.println(s2); => Ahmed Keller
```
| Heap            | SCP               |
| --------------- | ---------------   |
| s1 -> Ahmed     | Ahmed             |
| Ahmed Elhilali     | Elhilali          |
| s2 -> Ahmed El     | El                |
| s1 -> Ahmed Keller     | Keller            |
|
**Note:**
- For every string constant one object will be placed in *SCP* area.
- Because of some *runtime* operation, if an object is required to get created, that object will be placed only in the *heap* area, but not in *SCP* area.

#### Example 3: 
``` java
    String s1 = new String("Spring");
    s1.concat(" Summer");
    String s2 = s1.concat(" Winter");
    s1 = s1.concat(" Fall");
    System.out.println(s1); => Spring Fall
    System.out.println(s2); => Spring Winter
```
| Heap            | SCP               |
| --------------- | ---------------   |
| s1 -> Spring     | Spring            |
| Spring Summer    | Summer          |
| s2 -> Spring Winter     | Winter       |
| s1 -> Spring Fall   |      Fall      |
|
**Note:**
- For every string constant one object will be placed in *SCP* area.
- Because of some *runtime* operation, if an object is required to get created, that object will be placed only in the *heap* area, but not in *SCP* area.
