# Introduction

For writing any java program the most commonly required package is javalang.
## Example:
``` java
Class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```
In the previous example we depends on `javalang` to create:
- the class Test because every class inherits from class Object.
- String, because the String class exists in javalang.
- System, also exists in javalang.

For writing any java program whether it is simple or complex, the most commonly and interfaces are grouped into a separate package which javalang. 

We are not required to import javalang explicity because all class and interfaces are available by default to every java program.

## javalang.Object: 
- The most commonly required methods (whether they are predefined or customer classes) are defined in a separate class which is nothing but `Object` class. 
- Every class in java is a `child` class of object either directly or indirectly, so that *object* class methods available to every java class.
- Object class is considered as **root** for all java class.

**NOTE:**

- If our class doesn't extend any class then only our class is a direct child of *Object*.
- **Example:**
``` java
Class A {

}
```
``` mermaid
graph RL
    A --> Object
```
- A is the child class of `Object`.
- If our class extends any other class, then our class **indirect** child of `Object`.
``` java
Class A extends B {

}
```

``` mermaid
graph RL
    A --> Object
    B --> Object
```
This is called *multiple inheritence* which is **ILLEGAL**.

``` mermaid
graph RL
    A --> Object
    B --> A
```
This is called *multi-level inheritance* which is **LEGAL**.
**Conclusion:**
- either directly or indirectly, java doensn't provide support multi inheritence with respect to class.

## Object class methods:
- Oject class defines the following 11 methods:
  1. ```public String toString()```
  2. ```public native int hashCode()```
  3. ```public boolean equals(Object o)```
  4. ```protected native Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException```
  5. ```protected void finalize() throws Throwable```
  6. ```public final Class getClass()```
  7. ```public final void wait() throws InterruptedException```
  8. ```public final native void wait(long ms) throws InterruptedException```
  9. ```public final void wait(long ms, int ns) throws InterruptedException```
  10. ```public native final void notify()```
  11. ```public native final void notifyAll()```

- To check the methods in a given class we can use: 
  ``` java
  import java.lang.reflect.*
  class Test {
      public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
          int count = 0;
          Class c = Class.forName("java.lang.Object");
          Method[] m = c.getDeclaredMethods();
          for (Method m1 : m) {
              System.out.println(m1.getName());
          }
          System.out.println("The number of methods:" + count);
      }
  }
  ```
## toString():
- We can use `toString()` method to get a string representation of an object, `String s = obj.toString()`.
- Whenever we are trying to print object reference, internally `toString()` method will be called.
- *Example:* \
    `Student s = new Student()`\
    `System.out.println(s); <=> System.out.println(s.toString())`
- If our class doesn't contain `toString()` method, then *Object* class `toString()` method will be executed.
``` java
  class Student {
      String name;
      int rollno,
      Student (String name, int rollno) {
          this.name = name;
          this.rollno = rollno;
      }
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          Student s1 = new Student ("Ahmed", 101);
          Student s2 = new Student ("John", 102);

          System.out.println(s1);
          System.out.println(s1.toString());
          System.out.println(s2);
      }
  }
```
**output:**
  - Student@1888759
  - Student@1888759
  - Student@6e1408

In the previous example, Object class toString() method got executed, which is implemented as follows:
``` java
public String toString() {
    return getClass().getName() + "@" + Integer.toHexString(hashCode());
}
```
**classname@hashCode_in_hexadecimal_form**
## Overriding toString():
- based on our requirements we can *override* `toString()` method to provide our own representation.
``` java
@Override
public String toString() {
    return "Student name: " + name + "\nStudent rollno: " + rollno;
} 
```
## Wrapper classes:
- In all wrapper classes and collection classes, string class, string buffer and builder class `toString()` is orriden for meaningful string representation. Hence, it's highly recommended to override `toString()` in our class as well.
``` java
import java.util.ArrayList
class Test {
    public String toString() {
        return "This is a test";
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = new String("Ahmed");
        System.out.println(s); => ahmed

        Integer i = new Integer(10);
        System.out.println(i); => 10

        Arraylist l = new Arraylist();
        l.add("A");
        l.add("B");
        System.out.println(l); => [A, B]

        Test t = new Test();
        System.out.println(t); => This is a test
    }
}
```
