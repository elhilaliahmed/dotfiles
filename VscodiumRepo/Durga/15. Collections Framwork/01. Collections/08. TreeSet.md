# `TreeSet`:

- The underlaying datastructure is **Balanced Tree**
- Duplicate objects are not allowed
- Insertion order not preserved
- Heterogeneous objects are not allowed otherwise we will get runtime exception saying: ***class cast exception***
- Null insertion is possible (only once)
- `TreeSet` implements `Serializable` and `Clonable` but not `RandomAccess`
- All objects will be inserted based on some sorting order, it maybe default natural order or costumized sorting order

# `TreeSet` constructors:

``` java
    TreeSet t = new TreeSet();
```
- Create and empty `TreeSet` object where the elements will be inserted according to default natural sorting order
``` java
    TreeSet t = new TreeSet(Comparator c);
```
- Create an empty `TreeSet` object where the elements will be inserted according to costumized sorting order specified by `Comparator` object

``` java
    TreeSet t = new TreeSet(Collection c);
```

``` java
    TreeSet t = new TreeSet(SortedSet s);
```

**Example:**
``` java
    import java.util.*;
    class TreeSetDemo {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            TreeSet t = new TreeSet();
            t.add("A");
            t.add("a");
            t.add("B");
            t.add("Z");
            t.add("L");
            
            t.add(new Integer(10)); => ClassCastExeception
            t.add(null);            =>  NullPointerExeception

            System.out.println(t); => [A, B, L, Z, a]
        }
    }
```
## Null acceptance:
- For non-empty `TreeSet` if we are trying to insert `null`, then we will get **NullPointerException**
- For an empty `TreeSet` we can add `null` as a first element, but after inserting that `null` we can insert any other element because we will get a **NullPointerExecption**

**Note:**
- Until 1.6v `null` is allowed as a first element to the empty `TreeSet` but from 1.7v onwards `null` is not allowed even as a first element, that means `null` is not applicable at all for `TreeSet` from 1.7v

**Example:**
``` java
    import java.util.*;
    class TreeSetDemo1 {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            TreeSet t = new TreeSet();
            t.add(new StringBuffer("A"));
            t.add(new StringBuffer("Z"));
            t.add(new StringBuffer("L"));
            t.add(new StringBuffer("B"));
            
            System.out.println(t); => [A, B, L, Z]
        }
    }
```
- The previous code would give a runtime exception saying ClassCastException in old versions of java because `StringBuffer` didn't implement `Comparable`
**Theory:**
- If we are depending on default natural order compulsory the objects should be *homogeneous* and `Comparable`, otherwise we will get runtime exception saying: `ClassCastException`
- An object is said to be `Comparable` if and only if corressponding class implement `Comparable` intereface
- String, `StringBuffer`, `StringBuilder` and all wrapper classes already implement `Comparable` interface.

# `Comparable(I)`:
- It is present in `java.lang` package and it contains only one method `compareTo()`

``` java
    public int compareTo(Object obj)
```
``` mermaid
    graph LR;
        obj1.compareTo\obj2-->B[returns -value iff obj1 has to come before obj2];
        obj1.compareTo\obj2-->C[returns +value iff obj1 has to come after obj2];
        obj1.compareTo\obj2-->D[returns 0 iff obj1 and obj2 are equal];  
```
**Example:**
``` java
    System.out.println("A".comapreTo("Z"));  => -25 
    System.out.println("Z".comapreTo("K"));  =>  15
    System.out.println("A".comapreTo("A"));  =>  0
    System.out.println("A".comapreTo(null)); =>  NullPointerException
```
- If we are depending on default natural sorting order then while adding objects into the `TreeSet` jvm will call `compareTo()` method.

``` java
    TreeSet t = new TreeSet();
    t.add("K"); 
    t.add("Z"); => "Z".compareTo("K")
    t.add("A"); => "A".compareTo("K")
    t.add("A"); => "A".compareTo("K") => "A".compareTo("A") 

    System.out.println(t); => [A, K, Z]
```
``` java
    obj1.CompareTo(obj2);

    obj1 => is the object that is going to be inserted
    obj2 => is the object that is already inserted
```

- It is a balanced tree that looks like this:
``` mermaid
    graph TD;
    K --> A;
    K --> Z;
```
**Note:**
- If default natural sorting order not available or if we are not satisfied with default natural order then we can go customized sorting by using `Comparator`

# Difference between `Comparable` and `Comparator`:
- `Comparable` is meant for default natural sorting order
- `Comparator` is meant for customized sotring order
