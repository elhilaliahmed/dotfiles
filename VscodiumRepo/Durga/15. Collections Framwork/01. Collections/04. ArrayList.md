# general rules:
- Usually we can use collections to hold and transfer objects from one location to another location (**container**), to provide support for this requirement every Collection class by default implement `Serializable` and `Clonable` interfaces
- `ArrayList` and `Vector` classes implement RandomAccess interface so that any random element we can access with the same speed
- `RandomAccess` present in `java.util` package and it doesn't contain any methods, it's a ***marker*** interface, where required ability will be provided automatically by the *jvm*
``` java
    ArraList l1 = new ArrayList();
    LinkeList l2 = new LinkedList();
    System.out.println(l1 instanceof Serializable);     => true
    System.out.println(l2 instanceof Cloneable);        => true
    System.out.println(l1 instanceof RandomeAccess);    => true
    System.out.println(l2 instanceof RandomAccess);     => false
```
- `ArrayList` is the best choice if our frequent operation is retrieval operation because `ArrayList` implement `RandomAccess` interface
- `ArrayList` is the worst choice if our frequent operation is insertion or deletion in the middle.
# Difference between `ArrayList` and `Vector`:

| ArrayList   | Vector    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| .1 every method present in the `ArrayList` is non-synchronized  | .1 every method present in the `Vector` synchronized   |
| .2 at the time multiple are allowed to operate on `ArrayList` object and hence it is not thread-safe  | .2 at a time only one thread is allowed to operate on `Vector` object and hence it is thread-safe   |
| .3 relatively performance is high because thread are required to wait to operate on `ArrayList` object  | .3 relatively performance is low because thread are required to wait to operate on `Vector` object   |
| .4 introduced in 1.2v and it is non-legacy  | .4 introduced in 1.0v and it's legacy   |
|    |    |

# How to get synchronized version of `ArrayList` object:
- By default ArrayList is non-synchronized, but we can get a synchronized version of ArrayList object by using `synchronizedList()` method of `Collections` class

``` java
    public static List synchronizedList(List l);
```
**Example:**
``` java
    ArrayList l = new ArrayList();
    List l1 = Collections.synchronizedList(l);

    // l is non-synchronized
    // l1 is synchronized
```
- Similarly we can get synchronized version of `Set` and `Map` objects by using the following methods of `Collections` class.
``` java
    public static Set synchronizedSet(Set s);
    public static Map synchronizedMap(Map m);
```
# `LinkedList`:
- The underlaying datastructure is **double linked list**
- Insertion order is preserved
- Duplicate objects are allowed
- Heterogeneous are allowed
- Null insertion is possible
- `LinkedList` implement `Serializable` and `Clonable` interface but not `RandomAccess`
- `LinkedList` is the best choice if our frequent operation is insertion or deletion in the middle
- `LinkeList` is the worst choice if our frequent operation is retrieval operation
## `LinkedList` Constructors:
- **1. constructor**
``` java
    LinkeList l = new LinkedList();
```
- create an empty `LinkedList` object
- **1. constructor**
``` java
    LinkeList l = new LinkedList(Collection c);
```
- create an equivalent `LinketList` object for the given `Collection`
## `LinkedList` class specific methods:
- Usually we can use LinkedList to develop Stacks and Queues, to provide support for this requirement, LinkeList defines the following specific methods:
``` java
    void addFirst(Object o);
    void addLast(Object o);
    Object getFirst();
    Object getLast();
    Object removeFirst();
    Object removeLast();
```
**Example:**
``` java
    import java.util.*;
    class LinkedListDemo {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            LinkedList l = new LinkedList();
            l.add("Ahmed");
            l.add(25);
            l.add(null);
            l.add("Ahmed");         => [ahmed, 25, null, ahmed]
            l.set(0, "software");   => [software, 25, null, ahmed]  
            l.add(0, "venky");      => [venky, software, 25, null, ahmed] 
            l.addFirst("ccc");      => [ccc, venky, software, 25, null]

            Sytem.out.println(l);  => [ccc, venky, software, 25, null]
        }
    }
```
