# Introduction:
## Arrays:
- An array is an indexed collection of homogenous data elements
- The main advantage of arrays is that we can represent multiple values by using single variable so that readability of the code will be improved
### Limitations of arrays:
- Arrays are fixed in size that is once we create an array there is no chance of increasing or decreasing the say based on our requirement, due to this, to use arrays concept we should know the size in advance, which might not be always possible.
- Array only homogenous data type elements

``` java
    Student[] s = new Student[100];
    s[0] = new Student();
    s[1] = new Customer();
    => compile-time error: incompatible types, found: Cusutomer required: Student
```
- We can solve this problem by using `Object` types arrays.
``` java
    Object[] s = new Object[100];
    s[0] = new Student();
    s[1] = new Customer();
```
- Arrays concept is not implemented based on some standard data structure
- To overcome the previous problems of arrays we should go for ***collections*** concept.
# Collections:
- Collections are growable in nature, that is based on our requirement we can increase or decrease the size.
- Collections can hold both homogenoeous and heterogenous objectS.
- Every collection class is implemented based on some standard data structure
# Differences between arrays and collections:
- 

| Arrays   | Collections    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| 1. Arrays are fixed in size, that is once we create and array we can't increase or decrease the size based on our requirements  | 1. Collections are growable in nature, that is based on our requirement we can increase or decrease the size   |
| 2. With respect to memory Arrays are not recommended to use   | 2. With respect to memory are recommended to use  |
| 3. With respect to performance based are recommended to use  | 3. With respect to performance collections are not recommended to use   |
| 4. Arrays can hold only homogeneous data type elements  | 2. Collections can hold both homogeneous and hetrogeneous elements  |
| 5. There is no underlaying data structure for arrays  | 5. Every collection class is implemented based some standard data structure  |
| 6. Arrays can hold both primitives and objects  | 6. Collections can hold only object data type but not primitives  |
|    |    |

## `Collection`:
- If we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity then we should go for 
## `Collection Framework`:
- It contains several classes and interfaces which can be used to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity

| Java   | C++    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| Collection  => | Container   |
| Collection Framework =>   | Standard Template Library (STL)   |
