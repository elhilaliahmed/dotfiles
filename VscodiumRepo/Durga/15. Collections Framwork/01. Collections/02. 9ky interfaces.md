# 9 Key interfaces of Collection Framework:
    1. `Collection`
    2. `List`
    3. `Set`
    4. `SortedSet`
    5. `NavigableSet`
    6. `Queue`
    7. `Map`
    8. `SortedMap`
    9. `NavigableMap`

# `Collection(I)`:
- Igf we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity then we should go for collection
- Collection interface defines the most common methods which are applicable for any collection object
- In general `Collection` interface is considered as *root* interface for Collection Framework
- There is no concrete class which implement `Collection` interface directly. 
# Difference between `Collection` and `Collections`:
- `Collection` is an interface
- If we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity then we should go for `Collection`
- `Collections` is an utility class present in `java.util` package to define several utility method for `Collection` objects like `sorting, searching ...`.
# `List(I)`:
- It's the child interface of `Collection`
- If we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity where duplicate are allowed and insertion order is preserved then we should go for `List`

``` mermaid
    classDiagram
    Collection <|-- List
    List <|-- ArrayList
    List <|-- LinkedList
    List <|-- Vector
    Vector <|-- Stack
```
**Note:**
- In 1.2v `Vector` and `Stack` classes were re-engineered to implement `List` interface.

# `Set(I)`:
- It's the child interface of `Collection` 
- If we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity were duplicate are not allowed and insertion order not required then we should go for `Set` interface
``` mermaid
    classDiagram
    Collection <|-- Set
    Set <|-- SortedSet
    Set <|-- HashSet
    HashSet <|-- LinkedHashSet
```
# `SortedSet(I)`:
- It's the child interface of `Set`
- If we want to represent a group of individual object as a single entity were duplicate are not allowed and all objects should be inserted according some sorting order then we should go for `SortedSet`
# `NavigableSet(I)`:
- It's the child interface of `SortedSet` 
- It contains several method for navigation purposes
``` mermaid
    classDiagram
    Collection <|-- Set
    Set <|-- SortedSet
    SortedSet <|-- NavigableSet
    NavigableSet <|-- TreeSet
```
- `TreeSet` is the class that implements the previous interfaces

# Difference between `List` and `Set`
| `List`   | `Set`   |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| 1. Duplicate are allowed   | 1. Duplicate are not allowed    |
| 2. Insertion order is preserved   | 2. Insertion order is preserved   |
|    |   |

# `Queue(I)`:
- It's child interface of `Collection`
- If we want to represent a group of individual objects ***Prior to processing*** then we should go for `Queue`
- Usually Queue follow first in first out order, but based on our requirement we can implement our priority order also 
## Example:
- Before sending a mail, all mail id we have to store in some datastructure, in which we added mail ids, in the same order only mail should be delivered, for this requirement Queue is best choise

``` mermaid
    classDiagram
    Collection <|-- Queue
    Queue <|-- PriorityQueue
    Queue <|-- BlockingQueue
    BlockingQueue <|-- PriorityBlockingQueue
    BlockingQueue <|-- LinkedBlockingQueue
```
**Note:**
- All the previous interfaces(`Collection`, `List`, `Set`, `SortedSet`, `NagivableSet`, `Queue`) meant for representing a group of individual objects
- If we want to represent a group of objects as ***key-value*** pairs then we should go for `Map`.
# `Map(I)`:
- `Map` is ***not*** a child interface of `Collection`
- If we want to represent a group of objects as ***key-value*** pairs then we should go for `Map`
  
| Key   | Value    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| StudentId   | Student   |
| 1   | Ahmed   |
| 2   | John   |
| 3   | Mike   |
| 4   | Alex   |
|     |    |

- Both *key* and *value* are objects only
- Duplicate key are not allowed but values can be duplicated

``` mermaid
    classDiagram
    Map_Ite <|-- HashMap
    Map_Ite <|-- WeakHashMap
    Map_Ite <|-- IdentityHashMap
    Map_Ite <|-- Hashtable
    Dictionary_AbC <|-- Hashtable
    Hashtable <|-- Properties
    HashMap <|-- LinkeHashMap
```
# `SortedMap`:
- It is the child interface of Map
- If we want to represent a group of key-value pairs according some ***sorting order of keys*** then we should go for `SortedMap`
- In `SortedMap` the sorting should be based on key but not based on value
# `NavigableMap`:
- It is the child interface of `SortedMap`
- It defines several method for navigation purposes
``` mermaid
    classDiagram
    Map <|-- SortedMap
    SortedMap <|-- NavigableMap
    NavigableMap <|-- TreeSet
```
