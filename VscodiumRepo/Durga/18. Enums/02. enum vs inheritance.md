# Enum vs inheritance:
- Every `enum` is always direct child of `java.lang.Enum`, hence our enum can't extend any other `enum` (because doesn't provide support for multiple inheritance)
- Every `enum` is always `final` implicitly, hence for our `enum` we can't create a child `enum`.
- Because of the previous reasons we can conclude that **inheritance** concept is not applicable for `enum` explicitly and we can't use extend keyword for `enum`.
``` java
    enum x {

    }

    enum y extends x {

    }
```
- This code in not valid

``` java
    enum x extends java.lang.Enum {

    }
```
- This code in not valid

``` java
    class x {

    }

    enum y extends x {

    }
```
- This code in not valid

``` java
    enum x {

    }

    class y extends x {

    }
```
- This code in not valid
- We will get two **compile-time** errors saying: 
  - 1. `cannot inherit from final x `
  - 2. `enum types are not extensible`

# enum and interfaces:
- An enum can implement any number of interfaces
``` java
    interface x {

    }

    enum y implement x {

    }
```
# java.lang.Enum:
- Every `enum` in java is a direct child of `java.lang.Enum`, hence this class acts as base class for all java enums.
- It's an `abstract` class and it's a direct child of `Object`. 
- It implements `Serializable` and `Comparable` interfaces.

# Enum methods
## `values()`: 
- Every `enum` implicitly contains `values()` method to list out all values present inside `enum`.
``` java
    enum Beer {
        LAGER, IPA, ALE, SPECIALTY
    }
    class Test {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Beer[] b = Beer.values();
        for (Beer b1 : b) {
            System.out.println("Beer name is: " + b1);
        }
    }
```
**Note:**
- `values()` method is not present `java.lang.Enum` and Object classes. `enum` keyword implicitly provide this method.
## `ordinal()`:
- Inside `enum` order of constant is important and we can represent this order by using ordinal value.
- We can find ordinal value of `enum` constant by using `ordinal()` method: `public final int ordinal()`.
- Ordinal value is zero based like array index.
  
``` java
    enum Beer {
        LAGER, IPA, ALE, SPECIALTY
    }
    class Test {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (Beer b : Beer.values()) {
            System.out.println("Beer number is: " + b.ordinal());   
        }
    }
```
# Speciality of java `enum`:
- In old language enums we can take just constant, but in java enums in addition to constants we can take, method, constructor, normal variable..., hence java enum is more powerful than old language enum.
- Inside java enum we can declare main method and we can even run enum class directly from command prompt.

``` java
    enum Fish {
        STAR, GUPPY, GOLD; 
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Enum main method");     => Enum main method
        }
    }
```
**Note:**
- In addition to constants, if we are taking any extra memebers like a method then:
  - list of constant should in the first line
  - and should end with `;`
``` java
    enum Fish {
        STAR, GUPPY;
        public void m1() {

        }
    }
```
- Valid

``` java
    enum Fish {
        STAR, GUPPY
        public void m1() {

        }
    }
```
- Invalid, we should add `;`

``` java
    enum Fish {
        public void m1() {

        }
        STAR, GUPPY;
    }
```
- Invalid, constant list should be in the first line
---
- Inside enum if we are taking any extra member like a method compulsory first line should contain the list of constants, at least a `;`
``` java
    enum Fish {
        public void m1() {

        }
    }
```
- Invalid, we should add `;`

``` java
    enum Fish {
        ;
        public void m1() {

        }
    }
```
- Valid
---
- An empty enum is valid java syntax
``` java
    enum Fish {
    
    }
```
- Valid
