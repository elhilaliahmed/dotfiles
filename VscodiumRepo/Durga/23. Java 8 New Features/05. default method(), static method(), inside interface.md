# Review Anonymous inner classes vs Lambda expressions:
- Anonymous inner classes can extend a normal class
- Anonymous inner classes can extend an abstract class
- Anonymous inner classes can implement an interface wich contains any number of abstract methods
- Lambda expressions can implement an interface which contains a single abstract method (Functional interfaces)
- That's why anonymous classes are more powerful.

# Default methods:
- Until 1.7v Every method present inside an interface is always `public` and `abstract`
- Which means the following declarations are equal:
``` java
    void m1();
    public void m1();
    abstract void m1();
    public abstract void m1();
```
- From 1.8v default and static methods are allowed
- From 1.9v private methods are also allowed
- Variable wise there's no change, there is no ***enhancement***. They are always `public static final`
- Default method = virtual extension method = defender method

## Benefits of default methods:
- Take a look at this code:
``` java
    interface I {
        public void m1();
        public void m2();

        default void m3() {

        }
    }

    class Test1 implements I {
        public void m1() {

        }
        public void m2() {

        }
    }

    class Test2 implements I {
        public void m1() {

        }
        public void m2() {

        }
    }

    class Test3 implements I {
        public void m1() {

        }
        public void m2() {

        }
    }
    //....
    class Test100 implements I {
        public void m1() {

        }
        public void m2() {

        }
    }
```
- If I ever add a new method `public void m3()` to the interface the previous code will not compile. I'd have to go through each class that implements the interface and then provide an implementation for the new method there.
- Adding it the method as `default` doesn't effect the class that already implement the `interface`, they can `override` if they ever what a different implementation of it.
- Without affecting implementation classes if we want to add new method to the `interface` then we should for for *default methods*.
``` java
    interface Interf {
        default void m3() {
            System.out.println("Default method");
        }
    }

    class Test implements Interf {
        public static void main (String[] args) {
            Test t = new Test();
            t.m3();     => Default method // The code will work just fine
        }

        // You can also override the default implemenatation
        public void m1() {
            System.out.println("Overriding the default method");
        }
    } 
```
- `default` keyword with method can be used only inside `interfaces`.
``` java
    interface Interf {
        default void m1() {
            System.out.println("Default method");
        }

        default int hashCode() {
            return 10;
        }
    }

    class Test implements Interf {

    }
```
- `Object` class methods should not be overriden by an `interface`, because `Object` methods are readily available for any class.
## Multiple inheritance in classes:

``` java
    class P1 {
        public void m1() {
            System.out.println("P1 method");
        }
    }
    class P2 {
        public void m1() {
            System.out.println("P2 method");
        }
    }
    class Test extends P1, P2 {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Test t = new Test();
            t.m1();                 => This object will not know which m1() method to call. That's why multiple inheritance is not allowed.
        }
    }
```
- We can't `extend` more than one class. 
## Multiple inheritance in python classes:
``` python
    class P1:
        def m1(self):
            print('P1 method')
    class P2:
        def m1(self):
            printf('P2 method')
    
    class C(P1, P2): pass

    c = C()
    c.m1()
```
- In this case `P1` method will be prioritized, because it's the first class to be inherited.

## Multiple inheritance in interfaces:
``` java
    interface Left {
        default void m1() {
            System.out.prinln("Left interface m1 method");
        }
    }

     interface Right {
        default void m1() {
            System.out.prinln("Right interface m1 method");
        }
    }

    class Test implements Left, Right {

    }
```
- This code will produce the following error: class `Test` inherits unrelated defaults from `m1()` from types `Letf` and `Right`.
- But this problem can be solved if we override the `m1()` method in the `Test` class like this: 
``` java
    Test implements Left, Right {
        public void m1() {
            System.out.prinln("Our own m1() method");
        }

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Test t = new Test();
            t.m1();   => Our own m1() method
        }
    }
```
- We can also invoke a special implementation from the implemented interfaces like this: 
``` java
    Test implements Left, Right {
        public void m1() {
            Left.super.m1();        => Calling the method from the Left interface
            // or
            Right.super.m1();       => Calling the method from the right interface
        }

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Test t = new Test();
            t.m1();   => Our own m1() method
        }
    }
```
# class vs interface:
- classes are very costly, they require a constructor and object creation.
- interfaces are lightweight componants.
``` java
    public static void m1() {

    }
```
`static` methods are not related to objects, we can call them without creating any object.
- If we have only `static` methods, then it's better to go for interfaces.
- Because interfaces offer support for `static` methods as well.
### Calling a static method:
``` java
    interface Interf {
        public static void m1() {
            System.out.println("Interface static method");
        }
    }
    class Test implements Interf {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            
            Interf.m1();            => This is the only valid way.

            // This approach is not going to work
            m1();
            Test.m1();
            Test t = new Test();
            t.m1();
        }
    }
```
- inteface `static` methods are not available to the implementing class by default.
- `static` methods call be called just by the interface name.
- From 1.8v we can declare `static` methods in interfaces and we can even have a `main` method inside an interface.
```  java
    interface Interf {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Interface main method");
        }
    }
```
- The big benefit of being able to have `static` methods inside interfaces, is to have utility classes inside interfaces.
- interfaces are lightweight so it's better to use them whenever possible.
