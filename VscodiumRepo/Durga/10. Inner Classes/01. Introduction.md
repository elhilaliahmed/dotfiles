# Definition:
- Sometimes we can declare a class inside another classe, such type of classes are called *inner classes*.
- Inner classes concept introduced in 1.1v to fix *GUI* bugs as part of event handling, but because of powerful feature and benefits of inner classes slowly programmer started using them in regular coding as well.
- Without existing one type of object if there's no chance of existing another type of object then we should go for inner classes.

# Case studies:
- A `University` consists of several departments, without existing `University` there's no chance of existing `Department`, then we have to declare `Department` class inside `university` class.
#### ***Example:***
  ``` java
    class University {              // outer class

        class Department {          // inner class

        }
    } 
  ```
- Without a `Car` object, there's no chance of having an `Engine` objects, hence we have to declare `Engine` class inside `Car` class.
#### ***Example:***
  ``` java
    class Car {                 // outer class

        class Engine {          // inner class

        }
    } 
  ```
- `Map` is a group of key value pairs and each key value pair is called an `Entery`, without a `Map` object there's no chance of having `Entry` object. Hence `interface` `Entery` is defined inside `Map` `interface`
#### ***Example:***
  ``` java
    interface Map {            // outer interface

        interface Entery {     // inner interface

        }
    }
  ```
**Note:**
- Without existing outer class object there's no chance of existing inner class object.
- The relation between outer class and inner class is not **is-A** relationship and it's **has-A** relationship. (*composition* or *aggregation*)
